#Flickr Widget
[View this app in action](https://secure-refuge-22481.herokuapp.com/)! This project began as a simple widget which can be added to any site but evolved into a full fledged photo gallery.

##Implementation
Uses the Flickraw library to interact with the Flickr API. A user's ID is entered and then the first 100 photos of that user are displayed in a responsive grid of photos (*[with styling help from CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/seamless-responsive-photo-grid/)*)
